## Problem to solve and solution
Deciding what to wear on a daily basis can be a problem for some people, especially if they are in a hurry.
Our "Pair to Wear" web app will solve this problem. It does so by helping people pick matching outfits by letting them see a preview
of the complete outfit virtually prior to wearing it. The web app gets pictures from a Pinterest Board that users can personalize to
suit their style. Also, the web app displays a link to the weather for that particular day to facilitate users to choose an appropriate
combination of clothes. 

## Things we learned as a team
Some of the things/skills each member learned are: team work, time management, html and css basics, github usage(and outages),
bootstrap, and api integration.
